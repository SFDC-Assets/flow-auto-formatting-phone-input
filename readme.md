---

## Description

This component can be used on a Flow screen to collect a phone number:

* Auto-formats the number as you type, so you don't have to add dashes
* Implements the pattern for U.S. phone numbers, e.g. 555-555-5555
* Input can be required or optional
* Validates the entered value to enforce it as a required field, prevent incomplete or improperly formatted numbers, or both

## Install & Setup Instructions

**Please see the [Disclaimer](https://github.com/egyptguy/flowAutoFormattingPhoneInput#disclaimer)** (below)

1. Install the unmanaged package:  **[https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6g000008fjD3](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6g000008fjD3)**
2. Add the Auto-Formatting Phone Input component to a screen element.
3. Configure the componentâ€™s properties (see below).
4. Rinse and repeat as needed.

### Component Properties

When you add this component to a Flow screen, there are a few properties to configure:

| Attribute        | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Label** 		   | Visible label that appears above the input. |
| **Placeholder**  | OPTIONAL.  Placeholder text that displays prior to the user entering data in the input. |
| **Required?**		 | True/false.  Controls whether the user must enter a value to proceed in the Flow. |
| **Value**	       | OPTIONAL.  The initial value for the field.  Also used to store the user-entered value for later use in the Flow. |

## FAQs

**_Q: Can I format the number to use parentheses around the area code?_**

A: No, sorry, not at the present time. Right now it is hard-coded to support a 10-digit U.S. phone number with dashes (e.g. 555-555-5555).

**_Q: Does the component support formatting for non-U.S. phone numbers?_**

A: No, sorry, not at the present time. Right now it is hard-coded to support a 10-digit U.S. phone number with dashes (e.g. 555-555-5555).

## Caveats
* <strong>Not intended for use with screen flows embedded in Visualforce</strong>. Not even tested.
* Only supports a 10-digit U.S. phone number with dashes (e.g. 555-555-5555).
