/* MODIFICATION LOG
* 	Date			Developer			Story		Description
*   11/05/2022      Mitch Lynch         n/a         Removed standard validation occurring in the lightning:input to reduce the displayed error messages to a single instance. Added custom labels for error messages. General clean-up / removed instances of console.log() used for testing.
*   11/04/2022      Mitch Lynch         n/a         Renamed design attributes - replacing 'property' prefix with 'phone'.
*   11/03/2022      Mitch Lynch         n/a         Created base component.

/* NOTES
*
*	This component formats the phone number for U.S. standards only:  XXX-XXX-XXXX
*   It requires an area code and uses hyphens to separate the area code, prefix, and line number.
*   This standardizes phone number formatting in the data so that it (a) is complete and (b) can be searched and queried without any special tricks.  This is key to my use case, which uses phone number for duplicate matching.
*
*   LWC resources:
*     - Input component: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning:input
*
*	  - Auto-formatting based on some tips found here:
*			- https://tomduffytech.com/how-to-format-phone-number-in-javascript/
*			- https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/lightning_base_events.htm
*
*     - Validity logic mostly based on the Quick Lookup component from unofficialsf.com:
*     		- https://unofficialsf.com/lookup/
*			- https://github.com/alexed1/LightningFlowComponents/blob/master/flow_screen_components/quickLookup/force-app/main/default/aura/quickLookup/quickLookup.cmp
*			- A version of this might be more robust for a component with multiple fields: https://www.lopau.com/how-to-validate-lightning-component-forms-in-flow-screens/
*	  - Controller-side REGEX pattern
*			- Pattern found here:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31143315/regex-phone-number-with-dashes
*			- Validation based on some tips found here:  https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/376326/regex-for-lightning-input-in-aura-component
